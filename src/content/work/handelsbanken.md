Following my consulting work at Handelsbanken, I was offered full-time employment as a web developer. My duties stayed more or less the same: mainly front-end development and maintenance of the public web pages relating to credits and mortgages as well as a handful of internal systems. The main technologies I work with are React.js, Typescript, and Azure DevOps.
