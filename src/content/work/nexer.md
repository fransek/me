After my studies, I was accepted into Nexer Tech Talents' trainee program and was thus given the role of consultant in web development at Svenska Handelsbanken. The program involved a full-time position, education, and the possibility of permanent employment at Handelsbanken after the 12-month program.

My primary responsibilities included the development and maintenance of Handelsbanken's internet services related to loans. I mainly worked with the programming language TypeScript and the framework React.js.
