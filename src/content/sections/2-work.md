### Web developer - Svenska Handelsbanken

_Sep 2023 - present_

Following my consulting work at Handelsbanken, I was offered full-time employment as a web developer. My duties stayed more or less the same: mainly front-end development and maintenance of the public web pages relating to credits and mortgages as well as a handful of internal systems. The main technologies I work with are React.js, Typescript, and Azure DevOps.

### IT Consultant - Nexer Tech Talent

_Aug 2022 - Aug 2023_

After my studies, I was accepted into Nexer Tech Talents’ trainee program and was thus given the role of consultant in web development at Svenska Handelsbanken. The program involved a full-time position, education, and the possibility of permanent employment at Handelsbanken after the 12-month program.

My primary responsibilities included the development and maintenance of Handelsbanken’s internet services related to loans. I mainly worked with the programming language TypeScript and the framework React.js.
